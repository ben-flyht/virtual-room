# Dawkins code challenge

Meant to send this out in first week of Jan, but I have a Development Challenge for you all. It’s a control system for a State of the Art Virtual Room:

```
If the alarm is armed, then it should be triggered by the door opening.
If the alarm has been triggered, then it can be disarmed, but not armed.
If the door is open, the alarm's current state can not be altered manually.
If the door is open it can be closed.
If the door is closed it can be opened or locked.
If the door is locked it can be unlocked.
```

Inputs are arming, disarming the alarm, closing, opening, locking and locking the door. Can use any programming language / interface you want, but I should be able to use your thing without looking at the code (i.e. some form of UI).

Let’s say… Feb 28th Deadline? Go Team
